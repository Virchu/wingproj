#make batch=1
# need output file- stacks#
# pop map file- make file of each sample name (bam file name) and then identifier (can have 2 layers) (tab separated text file)
# make it 30 threads
# specify paths to sample --sample (directoty to samples)
# use default stack assembly 
# create B database- ends in _radtags  (Adar_S1_radtags)
# D description- stacks default settings
#--create_db

 remake popmap with location first, then biome
 
 
 #TROUBLESHOOTING
 
 load_radtags.pl 
 -D name of database
 path- just path to stacks, input file
 same popmap that you ran stacks on
  will put things up to database
  
  load_radtags.pl -D adar_S2_radtags -p adar_stacks2 -M adar_popmap_locbio.txt
 
 
 then run index_radtags.pl
 helps make searching fast and easy
 put in index
 -c and -t 
 
 index_radtags.pl -D adar_S2_radtags -c -t
 * is independent of load_radtags
 
 using popmaps-> pull out complete alleles/loci so that the same data set is consistent
 creates a white list- figure out which loci you like, then run populations as many times with loci that you want to use
 makes data set consistent 
 
 run rxstacks after I get stuff up to site
 
 
 aligning to a genome- doesn't mean sequence is from that genome-
 might go to things that are highly conserved in lots of things
 like wucheria stuff went to ribosomal stuff
 rna seq are maintained, nucleotide super conserved, no codons
 
 rxstacks -b 1 -P adar_stacks2 -o adar_rxstack
 
 redo c and s for rxstacks individually
 
 cstacks -P adar_rxstack -M adar_popmap_locbio.txt -b 1 -p 30
 
 sstacks -P adar_rxstack -M adar_popmap_locbio.txt -b 1
 
 add flag to make catalog in load_radtags.pl
 maybe some issue with mysql permissions?
 
 load_radtags.pl -D adar_S2_radtags -p adar_stacks2 -M adar_popmap_locbio.txt -c
 Kevin ran this from his computer after my 2 attemps
 1st attempt got errors and 0'
 2nd attempt got no errors but nothing
	ind screen error- mysql> select * from samples select 10
    -> ;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'select 10' at line 1
mysql> quit;

 3rd attempt from Kevins end and still nothing
