Unknown command line option: '-b'
ref_map.pl 2.0b
ref_map.pl --samples dir --popmap path [-s spacer] [--paired] -o dir [-X prog:"opts" ...]

  Input/Output files:
    --samples: path to the directory containing the samples BAM (or SAM) alignment files.
    --popmap: path to a population map file (format is "<name> TAB <pop>", one sample per line).
    s: spacer for file names: by default this is empty and the program looks for files
       named 'SAMPLE_NAME.bam'; if this option is given the program looks for files
       named 'SAMPLE_NAME.SPACER.bam'.
    o: path to an output directory.
    --unpaired: ignore read pairing (for ddRAD; treat READ2's as if they were READ1's)
    --ignore-pe-reads: ignore paired-end reads even if present in the input

  General options:
    X: additional options for specific pipeline components, e.g. -X "populations: -p 3 -r 0.50"
    T: the number of threads/CPUs to use (default: 1).
    d: Dry run. Do not actually execute anything, just print the individual pipeline commands
       that would be executed.

  SNP model options:
    --var-alpha: significance level at which to call variant sites (for gstacks; default: 0.05).
    --gt-alpha: significance level at which to call genotypes (for gstacks; default: 0.05).

  Miscellaneous:
    --time-components (for benchmarking)
