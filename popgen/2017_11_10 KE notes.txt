mv file newdirectory

go up a level in directory -cd ..

cp origfile /directory/subdirectory


Sequence alignment practice
scp to login to server to move file into new folder
geneious program on lab computer (maybe have it or something equivalent)

ways to generate genotypes
need to line up, stacks at certain parts
quality of reads to ref, lots of parameters to deal with, no realy right answer for which parameters are best

settings of old darlingi work
lots of ways to align sequence

bowtie and gsnap
gsnap us suggested parameters from Catchen
do it for 1 file
look up how sam files look that is generated
bam is binary computer readable and compressed
stacks has separate qc 
want to drop sketchy info, drop reads to get higher quality sequences

fastq, sam files important

samtools- for sam files, can have ie flags
ie how many reads mapped and how many didn't from sam file 

can check sequences with microbiome

for sequence- 
my sequence reads are in , ind fastq files, /illumina/Adarlingi_Chu_2017
copy one file over to directory
/genomes/Adarlingi/Adar_scaffolds is the ref genomes/Adarlingi/Adar_scaffolds


gff is an annotation file, has lots of info of what each looks like
like what you would see in vectorbase 

practice aligning
file- SJU3.fastq.gz

cp SJU3.fastq.gz /home/vchu/practest
# Align with GSnap and convert to BAM
# gunzip SJU3.fastq.gz to unzip the fastq file

gsnap -t 36 -n 1 -m 5 -i 2 --min-coverage=0.90 -A sam -d Adar_scaffolds -D ~ SJU3.fastq > SJU3.sam
		 
		 
samtools view -b -S -o SJU3.bam SJU3.sam


-t= 36 worker threads
-n= max number of paths to print (default 100)	
-m= max # mismatches allowed
-i= penalty for indel (def 2), counts against mismatches
-A= sam type
-d= genome database
-D= genome directory

   
 grep -v @SQ SJU3.sam| head
 
To run something without being connected 
program- screen
screen- makes new terminal
ctrl + a+d detaches
screen -r to go back to terminal
exit kills a screen terminal
screen -S nameofscreen

sam is a sequence file while bam is a binary, compressed version of sam

top - shows all processes being run by computer
-> load average- shows processor usage, out of 64 cpus on server  

good to check to see what people are doing on machine

samtolls syntax us weird
indexes things to see where things are, needed for stacks

parallel function- spreading computation across many processors, can help speed things up

get bam.bai- bam index file for each

run script from text file
shebang !# where to send it, point to where to run

linux oermissions
read, write execute
if you have a script, need to make executable
chmod +x filename
so in future ./filename
./ is to tell unix where to look
find where it looks first- $PATH
working directory is never in path

change owner of file to mean
modify kevins code for aligning

nano or emacs to modify
or download and modify


when alignments are done- 
bam_aligned_reads_summary.sh
need to write a loop for this file
for f in *.bam: do bam_aligned_reads_summary.sh $f >> read_summary; done 

look up sam tools
